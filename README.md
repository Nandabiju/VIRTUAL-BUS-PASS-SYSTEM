# VIRTUAL-BUS-PASS-SYSTEM
This is a mini project me and my team developed during my 6th semester as an alternative to the manual ticket issuing system of our college.The traditional paper-based method was slow, error-prone, and lacked security. Our system streamlines the process by enabling students to apply for passes, make payments, and access QR-coded digital tickets online.

    	•	Super Admin: Manage moderators.

	•	Real-time Seat Management to prevent overbooking (especially for hostellers).
	•	Secure QR Code Verification for authenticity and fraud prevention.
	•	Separate Booking Flows for day scholars and hostellers.
	•	Responsive Web Interface for easy use.

Tech Stack
